## Goals 🎯

The goals of this assignment are:

- Original motivation of DSL; Clear and convincing use-case.
- Design of language; extent of fit for use-case
- Quality of implementation; smooth user experience. Follows good software engineering practice (clear code, organized, comments, version control etc.)
- User evaluation: performing user studies & acting appropriately on feedback
- Evaluation of your own work at various stages, including analysis of user study results.
- Team management and organization: dividing & coordinating responsibilities within group, submission of the milestones on time, communication with your TAs, & correct video length

## Technology Stack 🛠️

To be determined.

## Prerequisites 🍪

You should have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your PC.

## Setup 🔧

1. Clone the repo using:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sassansh/Small-DSL.git
   ```

## Assignment Description 📚

### Task Description

- Think up a *use-case* for a new small *domain-specific language* (DSL)
  - Make this explicit: what will the DSL enable, and how? Submit your group's idea to your TA for feedback.
- Define the DSL informally on paper: its grammar and semantics
- Divide the project/implementation work into clearly-defined responsibilities

  - Make sure to use *version control throughout your project*; use the git repository we will provide to you.

- Perform a *task-driven user study* on the effectiveness of the language *before* you start implementing.
- Modify the language based on the results of the study; _redesign accordingly_.
- Implement the language (some possible techniques over the next lectures).
- Perform a *task-driven user study* on effectiveness of the complete language. Reflect on the outcome: what is your evaluation?
