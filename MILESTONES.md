# Milestones

Project Milestones are (lightweight) subgoals during the project, used to document your process and get explicit feedback from your TA (of course, you're also welcome to talk with your TA about other things!). Each milestone requires you to communicate information with your TA, get their feedback and add a short corresponding description to your project repositories. By default, you should speak with your TA during their office hours; it might take 10-15 minutes to talk through your milestone. Alternatively, if you arrange this in advance with your TA, you could either Zoom with them separately or communicate via email; it's your team's responsibility to organise how you'll get your milestones signed off if you don't attend the office hours. Once you've had TA feedback on the milestone, commit an entry to a MILESTONES.md file in your project git repository including a summary of the relevant information and any relevant notes from your discussion with your TA (this can be a paragraph or two; longer if you would like). The entry should at least briefly summarise the points from the milestone. Make sure to push your commit by the milestone deadline!

Milestone deadlines are by **Friday 5pm** for weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the course (by the end of week 6 you'll be about to submit the finished project!). Note that nothing stops you from discussing and submitting these milestones early if you'd like to (you could even submit more than one at once if you think you're ready). You can of course also do the corresponding work on your projects at any time; the milestones are the latest you should have thought through these points, but not necessarily the recommended times to do these parts of your project work.

**Milestone 1 (Week 2):** Brief description of your planned DSL idea. Notes of any important changes/feedback from TA discussion. Any planned follow-up tasks or features still to design.

**Milestone 2 (Week 3):** Planned division of main responsibilities between team members. Roadmap for what should be done when. Summary of progress so far.

**Milestone 3 (Week 4):** Mockup of concrete language design (as used for your first user study). Notes about first user study. Any changes to original language design.

**Milestone 4 (Week 5):** Status of implementation. Plans for final user study. Planned timeline for the remaining days.

**Milestone 5 (Week 6):** Status of user study. Plans for final video (possible draft version). Planned timeline for the remaining days.
